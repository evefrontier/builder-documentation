# Smart Turret

![](./images/banner5.png)

## Introduction
This guide will walk you through the process of building contracts for the <strong>[Smart Turret](/SmartAssemblies/SmartTurret)</strong> example, deploying them into an existing world running in Docker, and testing their functionality by executing scripts. 

## Example Functionality
This example alters the Smart Turret to have two specific behaviors:

1. It does not shoot at anyone in the specified corporation.
   
2. It prioritizes shooting ships that have the lowest percentage of health. This is done as a strategy, as it means that ships can be destroyed faster. A byproduct of this, is that groups of Smart Turrets will share targets if in range when several are used with this example. 

> 🔧 **Technical Note:** The game processes targets in reverse array order from calling the inProximity function. While the weight value is used for sorting, it's not currently used in-game targeting logic.

## Pre-Requisites
Make sure you have setup your tools with [this guide](/Tools) and your world if you are testing locally with [this guide](/LocalWorldSetup).
