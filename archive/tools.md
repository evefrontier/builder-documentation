<Steps>

### Step 1: Setup WSL

#### Step 1.1: Install WSL
Install WSL is the Windows Subsystem for Linux. It allows you to run Linux commands on your Windows machine. Install it with:
```bash copy
wsl --install
```

<Callout type="warning">
If you get an error about virtualization not being enabled, enable it through this [help article](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/enable-virtualization-on-windows-c5578302-6e43-4b4b-a449-8ced115f58e1) and try to run the install command again.
</Callout>

#### Step 1.2: Update WSL
Update WSL to the latest version with:
```bash copy
wsl --update
```

#### Step 1.3: Install Ubuntu
Install Ubuntu on WSL using:
```bash copy
wsl --install -d Ubuntu-24.04
```

#### Step 1.4: Access WSL
To access Ubuntu on WSL you can use:
```bash copy
wsl -d Ubuntu-24.04
```

### Step 2: Change Directory
Once you're in the Ubuntu instance through WSL, you can get better performance by changing directory from the host directory to the Linux home directory with:
```bash copy
cd ~/
```

### Step 3: Open File Explorer (Optional)
To access the files from your Windows machine you can run this command:
```bash copy
explorer.exe .
```

### Step 4: Installing general tools
Before you get started you need to either install, or make sure you have the required tools.

#### Step 4.1: Git
Install Git and curl with:
```bash copy
sudo apt-get install git curl
```

#### Step 4.2: NVM + Node.JS
Install NVM and version 20 of Node.JS by using this command:
```bash copy
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.3/install.sh | bash && . ~/.bashrc && nvm install 20
```

<Callout>
If you already have Node.JS installed, you can use ```nvm use 20``` to use Node.JS Version 20. 
</Callout>

#### Step 4.3: PNPM
Install PNPM, which is used as a more efficient version of NPM with:
```bash copy
npm install -g pnpm
```

### Step 5: Foundry & Forge
Install foundry, restart the shell and install forge with:
```bash copy
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash && . ~/.bashrc && foundryup
```

### Step 6: Fetch the examples
Fetch the Builder examples with:
```bash copy
git clone https://github.com/projectawakening/builder-examples.git
```
